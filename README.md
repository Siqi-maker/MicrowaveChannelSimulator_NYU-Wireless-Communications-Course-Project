# MicrowaveChannelSimulator_NYU-Wireless-Communications-Course-Project
This is Siqi Bai and Bingsheng Hua's course project for Wireless Communications by professor Sundeep Rangan. You can check the details in Report.pdf.
This repository presents a physics-based simulation framework for modeling indoor wireless propagation in the 1‚Äì10 GHz frequency range. Built in MATLAB, the project combines electromagnetic modeling and system-level analysis through a series of modular steps:

- **Multilayer wall reflection modeling** via transfer-matrix theory
- **2D ray tracing** using first- and second-order image sources
- **Knife-edge diffraction** for edge effects
- **Power-delay profile** and **delay spread** analysis
- **Path-loss exponent** estimation
- **Phased-array beamforming** gain simulation
- **3D spatial visualization** of beam paths and gain coverage

## Key Features

- Accurate modeling of layered dielectric wall reflections
- Frequency-sweep propagation analysis (1, 3, 5, 10 GHz)
- Spatial and temporal channel metric extraction
- Phased-array beamforming with directional gain control
- Visualization of power heatmaps, delay spreads, and gain patterns
